# [P5.js](https://p5js.org/)
### What is P5.js?
P5.js is a javascript graphics library. A graphics library lets your program display things other than text, like shapes, pictures, animations, and pretty much anything you can think of.
## [2048](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/2048)
The game 2048. Move the tiles with the arrow keys. Combine equal tiles to double their value. your goal is to create a tile with the value 2048 by combining tiles.
## [Asteroids](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/asteroids)
This one isn't finished yet. Right now, all you can do is move around and shoot. Move with WASD and shoot with your mouse
## [Conway's Game of Life](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/conway)
This is [John Conway's game of life](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a cellular automaton where cells live or die depending on the state of their neighbors. Click on the cells to toggle their life state and hit start to see what happens.
## [Display Graph](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/display%20graph)
This allows you to display any graph and then edit the locations of vertices by clicking and dragging. Currently, it randomly generates a graph, but theoretically, the code can be used to display any graph.
## [Genetic Steering](https://editor.p5js.org/mdelmonaco/present/HJpO5IJ7Z)  
These creatures need to eat green food and avoid red poison to survive. They starve if they don't eat enough, and have a random chance of reproducing with some mutation at every moment. Each creature has a radius they can see food, a radius for poison, an attractive strength for food, and a repulsive force for poison. What configuration is optimal for survival?
## [Ginchology](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/ginchology)
This randomly generates two ginchulates, which are a consonant sound, a vowel, and finally, an "nch". Ex: "dench"  
They just sound funny
## [Magnetic Pendulum](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/magnetic%20pendulum)
This simulates three magnets on a table with a pendulum hanging a magnetic object above the center. Depending on where you release the magnet, you could end up at any of the three magnets. Click and drag to release pendulums and see where they end up. Where the pendulum ends up is extremely sensitive to the initial dropping position. Here is a picture of where a pendulum ends up based on the starting position: ![](https://quasarbright.github.io/images/magnet%20pendulum.PNG)
## [Minimum Spanning Tree](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/spanning%20tree)
This generates a [minimum spanning tree](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Minimum_spanning_tree) of a random collection of points. You can add points to see how the MST changes
## [Polygon Fractals](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/polygon%20fractal)
Colorful polygon fractals. Click to iterate the fractal, press a key to switch between the two fractal modes:  
center mode: draw a dot at the center of a shape and draw the triangles going from the shape's edges to the center  
prism mode: draw a smaller version of the shape inside itself and draw lines connecting it to the old shape
## [Rainbow Radiation](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/radiation)
colorful lines fly out of your mouse cursor   
move the mouse and click to make the lines fly out in a spiral
## [random circles with no overlap](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/random%20circles%20no%20overlap)
## [random graph](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/random%20graph)
## [random squares with no overlap](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/random%20squares%20no%20overlap)
## [smart rockets](https://editor.p5js.org/mdelmonaco/present/BkJquZ1Ae)
There are two competing populations of rockets, each using gnetics and evolution to try to learn to reach the target by applying a series of forces to themselves. The populations don't interact with each other, but it's cool to see two at once. The better rockets have a higher chance of reproducing and there is genetic crossover between parents
## [Travelling salesman problem](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/travelling%20salesman)
This solves the [travelling salesman problem](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Travelling_salesman_problem) for a random collection of points.
