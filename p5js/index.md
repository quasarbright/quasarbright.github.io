## [Asteroids](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/asteroids)
This one isn't finished yet. Right now, all you can do is move around and shoot.  
Move with wasd and shoot with your mouse
## [Conway's Game of Life](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/conway)
This is [John Conway's game of life](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a cellular automaton where cells live or die depending on the state of their neighbors. Click on the cells to toggle their life state and hit start to see what happens.
## [Display Graph](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/display%20graph)
This allows you to display any graph and then edit the locations of vertices by clicking and dragging. Currently, it randomly generates a graph, but theoretically, the code can be used to display any graph.
## [Ginchology](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/ginchology)
This randomly generates two ginchulates, which are a consonant sound, a vowel, and finally, an "nch". They just sound funny
## [Magnetic Pendulum](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/magnetic%20pendulum)
This simulates three magnets on a table with a pendulum hanging a magnetic object above the center. Depending on where you release the magnet, you could end up at any of the three magnets. Click and drag to release pendulums and see where they end up.
