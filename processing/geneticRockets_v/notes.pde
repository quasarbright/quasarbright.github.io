/*
 - weird thing: rockets reproduce after they die
 - fitness based reproduction across whole population.
 higher fitness -> higher chance of reproduction
 - each gene has a chance to mutate
 - DNA genotype is a vector flow field
 - DNA phenotype is a particle's path on the screen
 - should make it so they die if they go out of bounds
 and reproduce if they survive
