probably have to zero out the stack before you run everything (otherwise, you'll start with random values)

should do some checking to make sure you don't overwrite RSP or generally go out of bounds

need to make the numbers smaller so you can loop around. +[+] takes O(2^word) which is like 9 quintillion
make it like ascii character size or something
