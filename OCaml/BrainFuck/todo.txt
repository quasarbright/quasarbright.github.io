probably have to zero out the stack before you run everything (otherwise, you'll start with random values)

should do some checking to make sure you don't overwrite RSP or generally go out of bounds

need to make the numbers smaller so you can loop around. +[+] takes O(2^word) operations which is like 9 quintillion
make it like ascii character size or something

I/O


after lecture:
only allocate like 1 million for the tape
blast it to 0s in the beginning???
set rsp to the upper bound
every <>, check bounds of rdi vs 0,rsp with cmp
every +-, check bounds of [rdi] vs 0,256 with cmp
for IO, use the calling convention to call c printf and stuff
    save and restore rdi
are you going to care about 64bit vs 32bit calling convention?
