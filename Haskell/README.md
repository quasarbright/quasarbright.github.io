# Haskell projects
## [Parsing Library](https://github.com/quasarbright/quasarbright.github.io/tree/master/Haskell/ParseLib)
A parsing library similar to parsec
## [Equation Solver](https://github.com/quasarbright/quasarbright.github.io/tree/master/Haskell/EquationSolver)
Simplifies mathematical expressions into standard form polynomials and finds their roots to solve equations
## [Unit Checker](https://github.com/quasarbright/UnitChecker)
Checks the units of simple physics expressions and equations.
## [Freer Effects](https://github.com/quasarbright/freer-effects)
An implementation of the paper ["Freer Monads, More Extensible Effects"](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf). This is an effect system which is an alternative to monad transformer stacks. Effects compose nicely and are described independently of their interpretation/semantics. This was my first time doing type level programming, and it was really cool! I made a type-aligned sequence, which represents a composition of functions as a tree in a type-safe way, and an open union, which is like `Either`, but can have any number of alternative types, not just 2. It was a really cool project, and gave me deep insight into free monads and how powerful they can be!
