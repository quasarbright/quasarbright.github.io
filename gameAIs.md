AIs I've implemented to play games better than I can play them

# [2048](https://github.com/quasarbright/2048)
This simple minimax 2048 AI plays at a very high level. Sometimes, it reaches the highest possible tile!

# [Tetris](https://github.com/quasarbright/TetrisAI)
I implemented guideline-compliant marathon Tetris in pygame that you can either play yourself or watch an AI play. I used a specialized minimax search with heuristics. It isn't optimal, but it survives for a very long time and can play at superhuman gravities since it thinks fast and uses few moves per tetrimino.
