This is my personal website. Here, I have a variety of different kinds of projects I've worked on for fun over the years. Most of the projects I've done can't be displayed on a webpage, so check my [repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/quasarbright) if you want to see more!
# [Machine Learning projects](https://quasarbright.github.io/MachineLearning/README)
These are some interesting things I did with neural networks, which are my favorite tool to work with in computer science. The code is stored in its own repository, MachineLearning.

This is a collection of interesting programs I made using p5.js. They can run in browser, so just click on a link and it'll run. The code is stored in the quasarbright repository.

This is a collection of interactive math visualization tools that my classmate William Liu and I created for our senior project in High School 
# [Where to learn stuff](https://quasarbright.github.io/where%20to%20learn%20stuff)
