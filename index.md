This is my personal website. Here, I have a variety of different kinds of projects I've worked on for fun over the years. Many of the projects I've done can't be displayed on a webpage, so check my [repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/quasarbright) if you want to see more!
# [Machine Learning projects](https://quasarbright.github.io/MachineLearning/README)
These are some interesting things I did with neural networks, which are my favorite tool to work with in computer science. The code is stored in its own repository, MachineLearning.
# [Subduce](https://subduce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)
This is a programming language I am currently making. It is a functional programming language based on Python and Scheme. It has scheme-like expression syntax, but python-like function definitions and variable assignments. I like scheme and pure functional programming, but there are just so many parentheses in scheme that it's not pleasant to read. I really like python and its syntax, so I tried to get the best of both worlds.
# [Unity projects](https://quasarbright.github.io/UnityProjects/)
These are some webgl games I made in the Unity game engine. Since they run on webgl, they can run right from your browser. The code is stored in its own repository, UnityProjects
# [Processing projects](https://quasarbright.github.io/processing/)
This is a collection of my most interesting Processing sketches. Since Processing is in Java, these can't run in browser. So I made some videos and screenshots of them running. These are stored in the quasarbright repository.
# [p5 js projects](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/index)
This is a collection of interesting programs I made using p5.js. They can run in browser, so just click on a link and it'll run. The code is stored in the quasarbright repository.
# [Interactive Math Visualization Tools](https://quasarbright.github.io/ThreePeriods/)
This is a collection of interactive math visualization tools that my classmate William Liu and I created for our senior project in High School 
# [Where to learn stuff](https://quasarbright.github.io/where%20to%20learn%20stuff)
This is a collection of places where I have learned things over the years. All of those resources are free and a good way to learn the topics listed. If you have a good resource for learning stuff online for free that isn't on the list, please suggest it by raising an issue [here](https://github.com/quasarbright/quasarbright.github.io/issues)
# [Art](https://twitter.com/QuasarBright)
This is my twitter page where I post art I make of characters from video games and shows that I like
