This is my personal website for hobby projects
## [p5 js stuff](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js)
This is a collection of interesting programs I made using p5.js. They can run in browser, so just click on the link and it'll run. If you want to see the code, [click here](https://github.com/quasarbright/quasarbright.github.io/tree/master/p5js)
## [Where to learn stuff](https://quasarbright.github.io/where%20to%20learn%20stuff)
This is a collection of places where I have learned things over the years. All of those resources are free and a good way to learn the topics listed. If you have a good resource for learning stuff that isn't on the list, suggest it by raising an issue [here](https://github.com/quasarbright/quasarbright.github.io/issues)
## [Tutorials](https://quasarbright.github.io/tutorials)
Programming tutorials
## [Machine Learning projects](https://quasarbright.github.io/MachineLearning/README)
These are some interesting things I did with neural networks
## [Unity Projects](https://quasarbright.github.io/UnityProjects/)
These are some webgl games I made in the Unity game engine. Since they run on webgl, they can run right from your browser
