# Michael Delmonaco
I am a software developer interested in programming languages, mathematics, physics, videogames, and rock climbing. I also make digital art based on characters from videogames and shows I like.

This is my personal website. Here, I have a variety of different kinds of projects I've worked on for fun over the years. Check out my [repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/quasarbright) if you want to see source code and even more projects!
# [Blog](https://quasarbright.github.io/blog/index.html)
This is my blog where I talk about cool concepts and projects I've worked on.
# [Programming Languages](https://quasarbright.github.io/programming-languages)
These are some programming languages I've made and programming language-related projects I've worked on.
# [Machine Learning projects](https://quasarbright.github.io/MachineLearning/README)
These are some interesting things I've done with neural networks. The code is stored in its own repository, [MachineLearning](https://github.com/quasarbright/MachineLearning).
# [Game AIs](https://quasarbright.github.io/gameAIs)
These are some AIs I've implemented to play games better than I can play them.
# [Shaders](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/shaders)

These are fragment shaders I made to display fractals and visualizations at a high detail and speed using the GPU.

# [Processing projects](https://quasarbright.github.io/processing/)
This is a collection visualizations made using Processing. Since Processing is in Java, these can't run in browser. I made some videos and screenshots of them running. These are stored in the quasarbright repository.

Many of these were based on videos by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw)

# [p5 js projects](https://quasarbright.github.io/p5js/index)
This is a collection of visualizations I made using p5.js. They can run in browser, so just click on a link and it'll run. The code is stored in the quasarbright repository.

# [Unity Games](https://quasarbright.github.io/UnityProjects/)
These are some webgl games I made in the Unity game engine. Since they run on webgl, they can run right from your browser. The code is stored in its own repository, UnityProjects.
# [OCaml projects](https://quasarbright.github.io/OCaml/index)
This is a collection of projects I made in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/). OCaml is a statically typed, compiled, functional programming language. For me, its killer features are algebraic types, pattern matching, and type inference. I first learned about OCaml in a compilers course I'm taking and I instantly loved it. After using the visitor pattern for union types in Java for the 100th time, when I saw a union type defined in just a few lines in OCaml, I was very impressed. And pattern matching is such a beautiful way to break down structured data and algebraic types.  
# [Haskell projects](https://quasarbright.github.io/Haskell)
This is a collection of projects I made in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). Haskell is similar to OCaml, but is more high level and has built-in monad support, which is very nice. Haskell felt like the next step on my functional programming journey after OCaml. It's a pleasure to write in, but I wish there was better tooling.  
# [Interactive Math Visualization Tools](https://quasarbright.github.io/ThreePeriods/)
This is a collection of interactive math visualization tools that my classmate William Liu and I created for our senior project in High School
# [Where to learn stuff](https://quasarbright.github.io/where%20to%20learn%20stuff)
This is a collection of places where I have learned things over the years. All of those resources are free and a good way to learn the topics listed.

Note: I stopped adding to this after high school.

# [Art](https://twitter.com/QuasarBright)
This is my twitter page where I post minimalist vector art I make based on characters from video games and shows that I like
